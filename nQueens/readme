A few random initializations that worked
[6 4 2 4 2 3 7 0]
[5 6 4 6 0 4 7 5]
[5 5 0 2 6 7 2 7]
[3 0 1 0 2 7 3 4]
[1 6 1 2 1 4 3 3]

There are two options for use:

1. Random Initialization
    To begin with a random initialization (not seeded), answer the prompt with a one (1) digit,
    followed by the number of queens you wish on the board.



2. User Entered State
    To begin with a user entered state, answer the initial prompt with a two (2) digit,
    then enter each element of the state one at a time as it prompts you.



Random Seed:
    The algorithmic solution of states is seeded so as to be reproducable, however as stated above the
    initialization of a random board is not seeded so as to provide a different board upon initialization per use.
